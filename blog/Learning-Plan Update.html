          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

          I would like to get an entry level position in the IT industry, whether it’s in development or technical support, as
          long as it’s a good entry level position with opportunities for progression I’ll be happy. There are many avenues you
          can go down in IT which I’m open to. Getting a government job where there’s a lot of experienced work colleagues would
          be great. I’m interested in both front-end and back-end development. I did one course in database administration which I
          enjoyed and heard DevOps is a good area to get into after a lot of experience. Learning everything about Cloud
          technologies- Azure, AWS etc. is important for career progression. It really depends on the job market. I think I’d more
          easily get a technical support job over a development job. I need to get a lot better at JavaScript and
          build some projects which could help me get hired. <br><br>


          <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          
          I feel like I’m reasonably easy to get along with. I enjoy collaborative learning environments. I’m worried about my
          lack of technical knowledge in JavaScript and need to get a lot more competent in that area. Trying to achieve deadlines
          under pressure will be challenging as well.
          <br><br>

          <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          
          Working well with others when there’s a tight deadline will be tough. If everyone is tired and stressed, we all need to
          try stay level-headed and do our best to meet deadlines. Reflecting well to feedback and implementing the changes is
          also a challenging aspect of the learning process. Managing myself so I don’t get overwhelmed. Not staying up too late 
          so I’m burnt out the next day.  
          <br><br>
          <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                •	Working collaboratively on group projects which will be done remotely<br>
                •	Collaborating in group discussions<br>
                •	Solving problems in groups and meeting deadlines through teamwork<br>
                •	Working under-pressure as a team<br> 
                •	Becoming more articulate, being able to clearly explain technical issues and talk through problems<br>
                • Becoming better at staying calm and collected under-pressure<br>
                • Sticking to deadlines
          <br><br>


          


          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          The same expectations as the facilitation team basically & they have been amazing!<br><br>
          • Kindness, Respect, Understanding & Professionalism<br>
          • Responsiveness<br>
          • Clear Communication<br>
          • All of This Goes Both Ways
          
          
          <br><br>
          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
          • I need to get better at JavaScript in the leadup to this Bootcamp<br> 
          • I just want to learn as much as I can<br>  
          • manage myself well because I don’t want to burnout<br> 
          • Be mindful and kind to everyone<br> 
          • Reflect well on feedback and try to implement it in the future<br> 
          • Soak up as I can from the people in my group that have more technical knowledge<br>
          • Be kind to myself & understand that it takes time, patience and perseverance to develop these technical skills 
          <br><br>

          <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
          •	If I’m really interested in something I’ll spend a lot of time on it but sometimes at the expense of other priorities<br>
          •	I enjoy problem solving. It’s really satisfying figuring something out, or when someone helps you and it works<br>
          •	I enjoy learning and teaching collaboratively. If I’m encountering a technical problem the chances are someone else has encountered it also<br>  
          •	I can push through and get work done when there’s a deadline<br> 
          •	Sometimes have a tendency to procrastinate<br>
          •	I could get better at managing my time<br>
          • Lack of programming experience. This is my first-time learning JavaScript. I’ve spent a short amount of time learning Python but it was only a beginner course. 
          <br><br>
          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>

            o	If I do become overwhelmed with the workload, communicate it with my facilitators and group members/if we’re working together.<br> 
            o	Sleeping and eating well, while managing my time effectively<br> 
            o	Taking breaks from the screen, getting a cup of tea, having a stretch<br> 
            o	Acting professionally when I am under pressure<br>    
            o	Understanding that all the learners are experiencing stress (we are in this together)<br> 
            o	Being compassionate and understanding to others<br>  
            o	Being respectful of others’ opinions and being mindful of social etiquette when working on projects together<br> 
            o	Reflecting on feedback well and not taking it personally<br> 
            o	Making use of the three counselling sessions available<br>  
            o	Making time for workouts at the gym and catching up with friends & whānau 
          <br><br>
          <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
          • Having a break from the screen <br>
          • Talk to someone close about the stress<br>
          • Discuss it with the facilitators<br>
          • Discuss it with my team-mates<br>
          • Ask if an extension is possible if things are particularly stressful<br>
          • Be open and honest<br>
          • Put in the mahi and don’t procrastinate
          <br><br>
          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          • If I’m working in a team and someone has a lot more experience than me, I might simply ask that person <br>
          • I’ll first try to research the issue and solve it that way<br>
          • If I have a technical issue, I’ll post it on the Slack page first<br>
          • If it hasn’t be addressed, I’ll message a facilitator<br>
          • If it’s a more serious issue I’ll find out who the appropriate person is to contact
          <br><br>
          <h3>Scheduling Information:</h3>
          • I’ll just try and fit in gym sessions in the late afternoon/evening when I can<br>
          • I have no serious commitments<br>
          • I might have to water the plants in the weekend on occasion for my family’s native plant nursery which doesn’t take
          long<br>
          • I have a wedding I have to attend in January on a Thursday but that’s about it
          <br><br>
