          <h3>What was the problem?</h3>

          I encountered a problem when doing the JavaScript Kata: Manipulating Objects activity. The question that I
          couldnâ€™t get
          past was - 7. Add a children property to terah and and use object literal notation to assign this variable to
          an empty
          object.<br><br>


          <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>

          I looked at various videos online, tried googling the problem, then I gave up and moved onto something else.
          The next
          day I saw some people had posted on Slack about the same problem. I looked over all of their conversations and
          tried
          out various methods. Replit is great because you can try something out and immediately see if itâ€™s worked or
          not. I
          eventually discovered that it mattered which ordered you put the code in. Even though the questions were
          ordered it
          didnâ€™t necessarily mean that the code should be ordered in that way.<br><br>

          <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          It was a bit frustrating at first, but I knew I had plenty of time and could try it again tomorrow. Iâ€™d
          already worked
          my way up to question 7 so I knew I was on the right track. It was satisfying figuring out the answers, that
          it matted
          in which order the code was in.
          <br><br>
          <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
          I already knew that the slack forum was helpful. Iâ€™ve actually found googling things not as useful as I
          thought. Itâ€™s
          always good to go back over a problem later. After staring at the screen for so long it just gets worse. Itâ€™s
          best to
          look at something with fresh eyes. If I was doing everything last minute that could become an issue because
          you donâ€™t
          have the luxury of coming back to the problem later.
          <br><br>


          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process
          </h1><br>


          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
          When I did an introductory Python course we explored algorithms and flowcharts. I havenâ€™t used a lot of Pseudocode yet
          but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll have to in the future. Getting more experience in JavaScript will definitely help during this
          bootcamp. For the Python course I also added a lot of comments explaining what each part of the code is doing.

          <br><br>
          <h3>Trying something</h3>
          Using Replit is really good for this strategy because you can instantly Run your code. Iâ€™ve done this a lot throughout
          the Kata activities. When trying something Iâ€™d also look at an example code as a template.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
          I havenâ€™t really done this method a lot either. I feel like this method goes will with Pseudocode. Having a break and
          going back to the problem is also useful, for rethinking and attacking it at a different angle. This method is useful
          because you need to take into account how busy other people are.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
          This is useful because it usually tells you the line number & VS code will underline things in red & display code
          that isnâ€™t formatted correctly.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Console.logging</h3>
          Running a function or more is important. I sometimes don't always know what exactly to run though.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Googling</h3>
          Always google. For JavaScript it's sometimes harder to find relevant information than initially thought. I feel that Python is easier to google ðŸ¤” 
          <br><br>
          <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
          I did this a lot when completing a one year Technical Support Diploma. I enjoy learning collaboratively. I need to be mindful of peopleâ€™s time though, especially
          when in the workplace. Timeâ€™s Money $$$. I need to have a good crack at something first before bothering people.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
          Iâ€™ve asked Emily, my facilitator for help a bunch. Sheâ€™s been amazing. 
          <br><br>
          <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
          I guess you have to reflect on the problems that are a hardest to solve & have the biggest impact. Maybe meditation is
          somehow useful. Itâ€™s meant to be good for everything. Chuck Norris probably does itâ€¦ A bit of loop listening might help
          too.
