                Whakawhanaungatanga: establishing and maintaining good relationships. Making time for family and friends. 
                We all need a good support system and need to support the people we love. Relating well with work colleagues is also important for career progression.
                
                Maintaining a healthy work-life balance: When I lived in Japan there were some people that worked insane hours to the point it was detrimental to their health. 
                I’d love to find a good job that I really enjoy so I can potentially put in longish hours but having downtime to enjoy hobbies and relax is important as well.
                
                Prioritization of physical and mental health/ Maintaining Wairua: Healthy sleep patterns, eating well, maintaining healthy relationships, 
                getting outside and appreciating how stunning Aotearoa is, staying fit & making time for hobbies all help.

                When my father found out he had terminal cancer I’d only just started teaching in South Korea. 
                He didn’t have long to live so I immediately quit my job to spend time with him before he passed. 
                After he passed, my Stepmother was left trying to manage the family business. I could have potentially tried to get another 
                English teaching job overseas and left but I decided to stay and try help. It was a real struggle trying to keep the business 
                running & to be honest, I felt resentful, having to quit a great job in South Korean. Being there for whānau is important, 
                we need to support each other and cultivate relationships, developing whakawhanaungatanga.

        <pre><strong><div class="identitysubs"> <subt style="background-color: rgb(239, 243, 11);">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity </strong> </div></pre>
        <pre><strong>
                
                “When you move to a different country, there are three ways that you can relate to the culture: You can confront,
                complain or conform. When you confront, you believe that your behaviours are the right behaviours. When you complain,
                what happens is that you isolate yourself into social bubbles of foreigners living in segregation with the society. When
                you adapt your behaviour, conforming to the society at large, then you can truly benefit from diversity….. We all see
                the world through cultural glasses. The lens through which your brain sees the world shapes your reality….It’s not about
                what you see; it’s about what you perceive” (How Culture Drives Behaviours, TEDx).

                I can relate to this while living overseas. Although, I’ve lived the majority of my life in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. I’ve
                been brought up mostly in a Pākehā context. When I was young my father found out he had Māori whakapapa, got involved in
                his Iwi and travelled around to various hui throughout the country. It impacted me at his funeral when people got up and
                spoke in Te reo Māori about how he had influenced them. I’ve tried to learn a bit about Te Ao Māori since then. My
                Mother’s family comes from the U.K mostly, I think. When I was a bit younger, my first big trip overseas, by myself in
                Thailand to train Muay Thai had a big impact on me. I experienced extreme culture shock and returned home early. I had
                to basically rebuild myself after that experience. Since then, I’ve returned numerous times and have fought twice over
                there. I’d love to fight over there again in the future.

        <pre><strong> <div class="identitysubs"><subt style="background-color: rgb(239, 243, 11);">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong> </div></pre>
        <pre><strong>
                
                Some of the positive characteristics I’ve been said to have are:
                
                • Loyal, a good listener, determined, caring, inquisitive, knowledgeable, honest and sympathetic
                
                Through self-reflection some of my strengths are:
                
                • Areas that I’m interested or passionate in I focus on a lot, but sometimes at the expense of other things
                • As I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more understanding and compassionate
                • I lived in Japan for 4-years which helped cultivate- adaptability, cultural awareness, language learning & teaching
                skills, working collaboratively, resilience and more
                • I have developed some resilience, but I’d like to increase it more so
                • I love working-out and try to take care of myself-eating well & getting enough sleep
                • I’ve been through various challenging experiences and learnt about myself throughout the process
                
                Whereas some of the areas that I need to work on are:
                
                • Tunnel vision where I sometimes get stuck on one idea and can’t see the bigger picture
                • Occasionally lack confidence
                • I need to work on better time management & improve on sleeping pattens
                • Throughout my MA I procrastinated like crazy, tending to do things last minute
                • I have difficulty focusing when tired & need to become better at stress management
                • My prioritization skills need improving
                • I need more experience working collaboratively & get better in interview situations
                • Taking responsibility instead of blaming the external environment
                • I can be socially awkward in larger groups of people I don’t know well. I want to improve my social skills for sure.
                • The last big interview I had, I got nervous and didn’t articulate my thoughts as well as I could have.
                • Managing myself when deadlines are due and I’m experiencing high levels of stress
                • Dealing with depressive like symptoms & pulling myself out of negative thinking patterns.
                • Giving myself a hard time over setbacks or factors that I can’t control. I didn’t perform so well in something, so I
                need to reflect on it and bounce back.

        <pre><strong>
            If I’m interested in a particular area of development, I’ll really get stuck into it. Although, I need to be mindful of
            my time management because I could spend a lot of time on that one area while neglecting others. I’ve been studying for
            past 2.5 years & am ready to get a job after this course. Completing the MA in TESOL was mentally challenging &
            developed my resilience. Hopefully I can draw from that experience and apply it in this Bootcamp. “Discipline is doing
            what you hate to do but do it like you love it.”

        <pre><strong> <div class="identitysubs"><subt style="background-color: rgb(239, 243, 11);">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</strong> </div></pre>
        <pre><strong>
            When teaching English in Japan collaborating with some Japanese teachers could be challenging. Being a teacher in Japan
            (not an assistant language teacher like I was) is tough and sometimes collaborative lesson planning wasn’t a priority.
            When I first started teaching, I had a difficult time navigating the cultural differences in communication. I would
            approach a Japanese English teacher I was working with because I wanted more responsibilities in the classroom. This
            straightforward approach actually caused more tension because the teacher already was incredibly busy. The lessons
            taught with me weren’t prioritized. I eventually got a grasp of this and when I was approached, I tried my best to
            collaborate. Understanding how stressed out and busy the teacher was and the cultural differences in communicative style
            helped. This occurred when I first moved there, each year thereafter, helped develop my cultural competency. Not being
            so self-absorbed & trying to put yourself in someone else’s shoes, so to speak, could help productive collaboration.
