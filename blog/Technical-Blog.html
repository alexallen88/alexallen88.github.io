    <pre><strong>
        I would like to get an entry level position in the IT industry, whether it’s in development or technical support, as
        long as it’s a good entry level position with opportunities for progression I’ll be happy. There are many avenues you
        can go down in IT which I’m open to. Getting a government job where there’s a lot of experienced work colleagues would
        be great. I’m interested in both front-end and back-end development. I did one course in database administration which I
        enjoyed and heard DevOps is a good area to get into after a lot of experience. Learning everything about Cloud
        technologies- Azure, AWS etc. is important for career progression.
