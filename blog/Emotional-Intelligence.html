      "If your emotional abilities aren't in hand, if you don't have
      self-awareness, if you are not able to manage your distressing emotions,
      if you can't have empathy and have effective relationships, then no matter
      how smart you are, you are not going to get very far." (Daniel Goleman)

          What is Emotional Intelligence?

            Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand, use, and
            manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress,
            communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges
            and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger
            relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career
            and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your
            feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions
            about what matters most to you. The skills involved in emotional
            intelligence are self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation,
            empathy, and social skills.<br /><br />
            <strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong><br />
            "It is very important to understand that emotional intelligence is
            not the opposite of intelligence, it is not the triumph of the heart
            over head - it is the unique intersection of both."<br /><br />
            Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the
            most common elements of your IQ include your ability to:<br />

            • use logic to solve problems<br />
            • plan and strategize<br />
            • understand abstract ideas<br />
            • learn and adapt to change<br />
            • grasp and use language<br />

            <br /><br />Your emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to your
            ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other people. It also
            refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behavior. In
            general, if you have a high EQ, you may find it easier to:<br />

            • identify emotions in yourself and others<br />
            • empathize with other people<br />
            • adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations<br />
            • control your impulses<br />
            • withstand temptations and delay gratification<br />
            • resolve conflicts with others<br />
            • communicate effectively<br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Why is it important?</strong><br />
            The value and benefits of emotional intelligence are vast in terms
            of personal and professional success. It is a core competency in
            many vocations, can support the advancement towards academic and
            professional success, improve relationships, and boost communication
            skills.
